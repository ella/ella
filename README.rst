Ella CMS
########

Ella is opensource CMS based on Django framework, designed for flexibility.

It is composed from several modules:

* **Ella core** is the main module which links the rest together. It
  defines architecture on which other modules are built but doesn't do
  anything really usefull all alone.
* **Ella core plugins** are plugins that are shipped in one package
  together with Ella. There are **articles** and **positions** which 
  we consider to be a basic toolbox for each Ella site.
* **Other Ella plugins** are standalone applications (and therfore
  not shipped with the core) that provide some
  specific functionality using **Ella's architecture**. We can mention
  polls, galleries, quizes and many more.
      
**Feature highlights**:

* Simple organization of content based on categories
* Efficent implementation of the published content
* In-build photo formating backend
* Django-admin ready
* Plugin system
* Flexibile
* Scalable
* Extensible
* Caching-friendly
* Well tested
* Proven in production environment
